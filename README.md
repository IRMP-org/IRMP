| Remarks | Decodes 40 protocols concurrently.<br/>39 Protocols to send.<br/>Work in progress. | Only one protocol at a time. | Consists of 5 libraries. **Project containing bugs - 45 issues, no reaction for at least one year.** | Decoding is very basic and easy to extend. |

\* The Hash protocol gives you a hash as code, which may be sufficient to distinguish your keys on the remote, but may not work with some protocols like Mitsubishi

# Pin usage
You may use **every pin for input or output**, just define it like `#define IRMP_INPUT_PIN 3` and `#define IRSND_OUTPUT_PIN 4`. The PWM of the output pin is generated by Software.

# Dynamic pins numbers
If you want to use pin numbers for input, output and LED feedback specified at runtime, you must define `IRMP_IRSND_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_PINS`. See [ReceiveAndSendDynamicPins example](examples/ReceiveAndSendDynamicPins/ReceiveAndSendDynamicPins.ino).<br/>
The `irmp_init` and `irsnd_init` function then allows up to 3 parameters `uint_fast8_t aIrmpInputPin/aIrsndOutputPin, uint_fast8_t aIrmpFeedbackLedPin, bool aIrmpLedFeedbackPinIsActiveLow`.<br/>
Be aware, only one pin and enable flag for receive and send feedback LED is supported.

# Receiving and sending simultaneously
Receiving and sending is possible with this library, but since we use only 1 timer, receiving is inhibited while sending the IR signal.<br/>
Sending the IR signal starts with saving current timer configuration, setting the timer to the send configuration / frequency, sending the signal (and waiting for the gap after the signal) and then automatically reset the timer to its previous (receiving) configuration.

# Compile options / macros for this library
To customize the library to different requirements, there are some compile options / macros available, which must be set **before** including the library e.g. with `#include <irmp.c.h>`.<br/>
Modify it by setting the value to 1 or 0. Or define the macro with the -D compiler option for global compile (the latter is not possible with the Arduino IDE, so consider using [Sloeber](https://eclipse.baeyens.it).<br/>

| Macro | Enable value | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `IRMP_INPUT_PIN` | defined | The pin number which gets compiled in, if not using `IRMP_IRSND_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_PINS`. |
| `IRMP_FEEDBACK_LED_PIN` | defined | The pin number for the feedback led which gets compiled in, if not using `IRMP_IRSND_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_PINS`.<br/> If not defined, `LED_BUILTIN` ist taken. |
| `FEEDBACK_LED_IS_ACTIVE_LOW` | defined | Required on some boards (like my ESP8266 board), where the feedback LED is active low. |
| `IRMP_IRSND_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_PINS` | defined | Allows to specify pin number at `irmp_init()` -see above. This requires additional program space. |
| `IRMP_PROTOCOL_NAMES` | 1 | Enable protocol number mapping to protocol strings - needs some program memory. |
| `IRMP_USE_COMPLETE_CALLBACK` | 1 | Use Callback if complete data was received. Requires call to `irmp_register_complete_callback_function()`. |
| `IRMP_ENABLE_PIN_CHANGE_INTERRUPT` | defined | Use [Arduino attachInterrupt()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/) and do **no polling with timer ISR**. This **restricts the available input pins**. The results are equivalent to results aquired with a sampling rate of 15625 Hz (chosen to avoid time consuming divisions). For AVR boards an own interrupt handler for  INT0 or INT1 is used instead of Arduino attachInterrupt().  |
| `IRMP_ENABLE_RELEASE_DETECTION` | 1 | If user releases a key on the remote control, last protocol/address/command will be returned with flag `IRMP_FLAG_RELEASE` set. |
| `IRMP_HIGH_ACTIVE` | 1 | Set to 1 if you use a RF receiver, which has an active HIGH output signal. |
| `IRMP_32_BIT` | 1 | This enables MERLIN protocol, but decreases performance for AVR. |
| `F_INTERRUPTS` |  | The IRMP sampling frequency. Default value is 15000.|
| `USE_ONE_TIMER_FOR_IRMP_AND_IRSND` | defined | **Must** be defined if you use receiving and sending simultaneously, since both use the same timer resource. |
| `IRSND_USE_CALLBACK` | 1 | Calls a function if send output signal changes to active (sending the IR signal). |
| `IR_OUTPUT_IS_ACTIVE_LOW` | defined | Output LOW for active IR signal. Use it if IR LED is connected between VCC and output pin. |
| `IRSND_GENERATE_NO_SEND_RF` | defined | Do not generate the carrier frequency (of 38 kHz), just simulate an active low receiver signal. |
| `IRSND_IR_FREQUENCY` | | The modulation frequency for sent signal. Default value is 38000. The send signal is generated by bit banging, so the internal interrupt frequency is `IRSND_IR_FREQUENCY * 2`. The send control function is called at a rate of `IRSND_IR_FREQUENCY / 2`, resulting in a send packet signal resolution of 2 on/off periods. |

### Modifying compile options with Arduino IDE
First use *Sketch > Show Sketch Folder (Ctrl+K)*.<br/>
If you did not yet stored the example as your own sketch, then you are instantly in the right library folder.<br/>
Otherwise you have to navigate to the parallel `libraries` folder and select the library you want to access.<br/>
In both cases the library files itself are located in the `src` directory.<br/>

### Modifying compile options with Sloeber IDE
If you are using Sloeber as your IDE, you can easily define global symbols with *Properties > Arduino > CompileOptions*.<br/>

# Easy migrating your code from IRremote to IRMP
See also the [SimpleReceiver example](examples/SimpleReceiver/SimpleReceiver.ino).

### Change the include and declarations from:
```
#include <IRremote.h>
#define IR_RECEIVER_PIN 3
IRrecv myReceiver(IR_RECEIVER_PIN);
decode_results results;
```
to
```
#define IRMP_INPUT_PIN 3
#define IRMP_PROTOCOL_NAMES 1
#include <irmpSelectMain15Protocols.h>
#include <irmp.c.h>
IRMP_DATA irmp_data[1];
```

### Change in setup:
`myReceiver.enableIRIn();` to `irmp_init();`

### Changes to get the data:
`if (myReceiver.decode(&results))` to `if (irmp_get_data(&irmp_data[0]))`<br/>
and<br/>
`switch (results.value)` to `switch (irmp_data[0].command)`.

You do not need **`myReceiver.resume();`** any more, just delete it.

The IR code representation of IRMP is different from that in IRremote. In IRMP (as in IRLremote) it is more standard and simpler. Use the function `irmp_result_print(&irmp_data[0])` to print the IR code representation. See [SimpleReceiver example](examples/SimpleReceiver/SimpleReceiver.ino).

If you want to distinguish between more than one remote in one sketch, you may also use `irmp_data[0].address` like it is done in the [Callback example](examples/Callback/Callback.ino).

# [Timer usage](https://github.com/ukw100/IRMP/blob/master/src/IRTimer.cpp.h#L39)
The IRMP **receive** library works by polling the input pin at a rate of 10 to 20 kHz. Default is 15 kHz.<br/>
Many protocols can be received **without timer usage**, just by using interrupts from the input pin by defining `IRMP_ENABLE_PIN_CHANGE_INTERRUPT`. See [Interrupt example](examples/Interrupt/Interrupt.ino).<br/>
**In interrupt mode, the `micros()` function is used as timebase.**

The IRMP **send** library works by bit banging the output pin at a frequency of 38 kHz. This **avoids blocking waits** and allows to choose an **arbitrary pin**, you are not restricted to PWM generating pins like pin 3 or 11. The interrupts for send pin bit banging requires 50% CPU time on a 16 MHz AVR.<br/>
If both receiving and sending is required, the timer is set up for receiving and reconfigured for the duration of sending data, thus preventing receiving in polling mode while sending data.<br/>
The **tone() library (using timer 2) is still available**. You can use it alternating with IR receive and send, see [ReceiveAndSend example](examples/ReceiveAndSend/ReceiveAndSend.ino).<br/>

- For AVR **timer 2 (Tone timer)** is used for receiving **and** sending.
 For variants, which have no timer 2 like ATtiny85 or ATtiny167, **timer 1** (or timer 0 for digispark core) is used.
- For SAMD **TC3** is used.
- For Apollo3 **Timer 3 segment B** is used.
- For ESP8266 and ESP32 **timer1** is used.
- For STM32 (BluePill) **timer 3 (Servo timer) channel 1** is used as default.<br/>

# Tips and tricks
- To port the library to another device, you merely have to extend *IRTimer.cpp.h*.
- The minimal CPU clock required for receiving is 8MHz.
- To save power, you can use the interrupt mode or polling mode with no-sending detection and power down sleep.
 This is **not available** for ATtiny85 running with the High Speed PLL clock (as on  Digispark boards) 
 because of the high startup time from sleep of 4 to 5 ms for this clock. You have to use the ISP to [rewrite the CKSEL fuses](https://github.com/ArminJo/micronucleus-firmware/blob/master/utils/Write%2085%20Fuses%20E2%20DF%20FF%20-%20ISP%20Mode%20%3D%208MHz%20without%20BOD%20and%20Pin5.cmd) and to load the program.
 - The best way to **increase the IR power** is to use 2 or 3 IR diodes in series. 
 One diode requires 1.1 to 1.5 volt so you can supply 3 diodes with a 5 volt output.To keep the current, 
 you must reduce the resistor by (5 - 1.3) / (5 - 2.6) = 1.5 e.g. from 150 ohm to 100 ohm for 25 mA and 2 diodes with 1.3 volt and a 5 volt supply.
 For 3 diodes it requires factor 2.5 e.g. from 150 ohm to 60 ohm.
- A lot of recent IR diodes can be powered with max. 200 mA at 50% duty cycle, but for this you will require an external driver / transistor / (mos)fet.
